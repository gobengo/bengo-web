  <h1>Now Featuring /questions</h1>
  <p>Sometimes I like to ask the internet for help or poll a lot of people and compare and contrast all the disparate answers. For that purpose, I've added a new section to this site, <a href="http://bengo.is/questions/">/questions</a>.</p>
  <p>The first question is "<a href="http://localhost:8080/questions/what%20is%20the%20most%20pythonic%20web%20library%3F">What is the most 'Pythonic' web library?</a>". Recently I have just been learning raw-<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI</a>, which can sometimes be ugly. I recently read about <a href="http://webob.org/">WebOb</a>, and it looks like a nice, small way of encapsulating some of the helper functions I've already had to make. But there are so many other options! Which have you found to be most helpful?</p>
  <p>I'll do my best to mark up these questions in a machine-readable way. This first one includes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</a> indicating that it is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-question">as:Question</a>.</p>
  <p>There is no affordance right now to create a response to this question that is hosted on this site. As an alternative, I encourage you to post your response somewhere else, a link back to the question with an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to">in-reply-to</a> relation. If you <a href="">webmention</a>, my provider ought to catch the response and hold onto it for me until I can render them with the questions in the future. In the future, I also hope to list questions there that others have asked of me.</p>
  <p>Thanks in advance for all your answers and help in the future!</p>
